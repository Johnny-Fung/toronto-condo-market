# Visualization of Toronto's Housing Market

[johnnyfung.ca/toronto-housing-market/](https://johnnyfung.ca/toronto-housing-market/)


A tool to visualize Toronto's housing market, based on sale prices of condos in the different districts of Toronto with data as of Q3 2019. The graphs display the historical price averages by district to see how the prices fared relative to the entire city's price trend. Inspired from my recent research of Toronto condo prices after listing a condo for sale. 

The tool implements the Leaflet and Chart.js Javascript libraries. 

Data Sources:
